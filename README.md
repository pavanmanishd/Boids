# Boids Algorithm - augmented for distributed consensus

***Live demo: [Click Here](https://pavanmanishd.github.io/Boids/)***


This is a simple implementation of the Boids algorithm, augmented for distributed consensus. The Boids algorithm is a simple algorithm that simulates the flocking behavior of birds. The algorithm is based on three simple rules:

1. **Separation**: Boids try to maintain a minimum distance from each other to avoid collisions.
2. **Alignment**: Boids try to align their velocity with the average velocity of their neighbors.
3. **Cohesion**: Boids try to move towards the center of mass of their neighbors.
